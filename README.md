# Stock Price Forecasting Using LSTM 📈🧠

This project uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict stock prices based on historical time series data.

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- TensorFlow/Keras
- yfinance (for data)

## 📊 Key Steps
1. Downloaded stock data using `yfinance`
2. Preprocessed and normalized data for LSTM input
3. Created training sequences from time series
4. Built and trained an LSTM model using Keras
5. Evaluated prediction performance and visualized results
